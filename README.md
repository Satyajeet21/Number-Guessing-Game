# Number-Guessing-Game
A number guessing game aims to guess the number that the program has come up with. 
<p> # Essentially the program logic is: </p>
<p> - The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100 or any other combination of numbers. </p>
<p> - It will then ask the player to enter his proposal. </p>
<p> - It will then check if this number is the same as the one generated randomly by the computer; if so, the player wins. </p>
<p> - If the player’s guess is not the same, then he will check if the number is higher or lower than the guess and tell the player.</p>
